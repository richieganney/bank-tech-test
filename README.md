## Solution

I decided to model my solution into a single class because it allowed for a
simple but effective foundation from which I could launch the development
cycle.

## Gems

- pry - lets you interact with your program quickly and easily through the command line. It also runs all of your tests for you once you have finished.
- simplecov - for test coverage.
